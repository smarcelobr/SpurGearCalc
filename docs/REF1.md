# Equations

    Base Circle Pitch	 DB = D cosφ  

    Circular Pitch       p = ( π D )/ N
                         p = π / P

    Center Distance      C = Np (mG + 1) / 2P
                         C = ( Dp + DG ) / 2
                         C = ( NG + Np ) / 2P
                         C = (NG + Np) p / 2P
                         C = (NG + Np) p / 6.2832

    Diametral Pitch      P = π / p
                         P = N / D
                         P = [ Np ( mG + 1) ] / 2C

    Gear Ratio           mG = NG / Np

    Number of Teeth      N = P D
                         N = ( π D ) / p
    
    Outside Diameter     DO = ( N + 2 ) / P
    (Full Depth Teeth)   DO = [ ( N + 2 ) p ] / π

    Outside Diameter     DO = ( N + 1.6 ) / P
    (American Standard   DO = [ ( N + 1.6 ) p ] / π
     Stub Teeth)

    Outside Diameter     DO = D + 2a

    Pitch Diameter       D = N / P
                         D = (N p ) / π

    Root Diameter	     DR = D - 2b

    Whole Depth          a + b

    Working Depth	     aG + ap
