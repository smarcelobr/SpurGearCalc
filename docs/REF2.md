## Symbols related to Gear Tooth Profile 

### Module
- Symbols : module ![m](module.jpg)
- Formula : p/π
- Definition : Module is the unit size indicated in millimeter (mm). The value is calculated from dividing the reference pitch by Pi (π).

### Pitch
- Symbols : pitch ![p](pitch.jpg)
- Formula : πm
- Definition : Reference Pitch is the distance between corresponding points on adjacent teeth. The value is calculated from multiplying Module m by Pi(π).

### Pressure Angle 
- Symbols : pressure angle ![alpha](pressure-angle-4.jpg)
- Formula : (Degree)
- Definition : The angle of a gear tooth leaning against a normal reference line.

### Addendum
- Symbols : addendum ![ha](addendum.jpg)
- Formula : 1.00m
- Definition : The distance between reference line and tooth tip.

### Dedendum
- Symbols : dedendum ![hf](dedendum.jpg)
- Formula : 1.25m
- Definition : The distance between reference line and tooth root.

### Tooth Depth
- Symbols : tooth depth ![h](tooth-depth.jpg)
- Formula : 2.25m
- Definition : The distance between tooth tip and tooth root.

### Working Depth
- Symbols : working depth ![hw](working-depth.jpg)
- Formula : 2.00m
- Definition : Depth of tooth meshed with the mating gear.

### Tip and Root Clearance 
- Symbols : tip and root clearance ![c](tip-and-root-clearance.jpg)
- Formula : 0.25m
- Definition : The distance (clearance) between tooth root and the tooth tip of mating gear.

### Dedendum Fillet Radius 
- Symbols : Dedendum fillet radius ![pf](Dedendum-fillet-radius.jpg)
- Formula : 0.38m
- Definition : The radius of curvature between tooth surface and the tooth root.
